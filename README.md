Tom's Home Flight Simulator Cockpit project based on the A-10 Thunderbolt II Warthog aircraft flown by the United States Air Force.  

This repo contains the following:
* Patched LUA Code for the use in the A-10 Thunderbolt II Warthog aircraft inside the DCS Flight Simulator platform. 
* C Code for the Arduino Platform of microcontrollers which drives all the panels including switches / LEDs / POTs / OLED displays / Stepper motors / Rotary encoders /  
* CNC Design Files for cockpit parts in Vectric Aspire CAD format

The supplied GCODE and Toolpaths contained in the CNC design files are for *MY* CNC mills and tooling.  Using these directly on your CNC machine will most certainly cause it to bottom out / break tools or go out of limits.  You could even injure yourself.  You WILL need to re-compute all Toolpaths and GCODE for use on your machine before any cutting, engraving or milling begins.
